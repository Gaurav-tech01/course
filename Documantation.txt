Backend In NodeJS
Database: MongoDB

In the documantaion and the code I have used express validator to ensure data integrity and to check is email is valid or not and give a response as well.
There test cases also for every API endpoints.

//API to register user
//URL: localhost:3001/auth/createuser

Sample Request :
{
    "username":"gaurav",
    "email":"aravsaraiwala20@gmail.com",
    "password":"123654789"
}

Sample Response :
{
    "success": true,
    "authToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjp7ImlkIjoiNjUxODgwMzAzZDhlYjM2MTBhODhiMGY0In0sImlhdCI6MTY5NjEwNDQ5Nn0.q325npLTxSWrofX-UVIlwuh1El7DGr5rI7kR7GrFRtE"
}

In this request the api will return auth-token which is unique for every user.
It will be used to validate if person enrolling in course or listing course is valid person or not.
This token will be send as header in rest of the API's.

//API to create Course
// URL : localhost:3001/course/createCourse
Sample Request:{
    header:
    auth-token:eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjp7ImlkIjoiNjUxODgwMzAzZDhlYjM2MTBhODhiMGY0In0sImlhdCI6MTY5NjEwNDQ5Nn0.q325npLTxSWrofX-UVIlwuh1El7DGr5rI7kR7GrFRtE
    body:{
        "title":"Os Course",
    "description":"The best os course",
    "instructor":"Gaurav"
    }
}

Sample Response:{
    "success": true,
    "course": {
        "userId": "651880303d8eb3610a88b0f4",
        "title": "Os Course",
        "description": "The best os course",
        "instructor": "Gaurav",
        "_id": "6518803e3d8eb3610a88b0f7",
        "__v": 0
    }
}

in the course model there is userId which is taken as automatically generated and stored in database or authentication of valid user.

//Course listing
//Url:localhost:3001/course/getCourse

it only takes header as the request 
and give response of all the courses
Sample Response:
[
    {
        "_id": "651880073d8eb3610a88b0f1",
        "userId": "65187e908b1499caaab06fcf",
        "title": "DSA Course",
        "description": "The best dsa course",
        "instructor": "Gaurav",
        "__v": 0
    },
    {
        "_id": "6518803e3d8eb3610a88b0f7",
        "userId": "651880303d8eb3610a88b0f4",
        "title": "Os Course",
        "description": "The best os course",
        "instructor": "Gaurav",
        "__v": 0
    }
]

//API to enroll
//Url: localhost:3001/enroll/CourseEnroll/651880073d8eb3610a88b0f1

In enrollment also no body should be given only header for authentication
and courseId in the Url as params.

It will generate a sample response containing user id of the user who enrolled the course and the courseId in which the user has enrolled
Sample Response:
{
    "success": true,
    "enrolledCouse": {
        "userId": "651880303d8eb3610a88b0f4",
        "courseId": "651880073d8eb3610a88b0f1",
        "_id": "65188183110b2d5ae16ac6cf",
        "__v": 0
    }
}
